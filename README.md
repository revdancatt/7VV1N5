## About

7VV1N5, pronounced "Twins" is a meta project where the individual pieces make up a larger work when placed together. The idea was to design it and price is in such a way that people could collect pairs, or "twins" to put together.

The collection as a whole is a play on my previous projects (mainly 70s Pop) which are built around placing tiles together to form larger structures.

This also introduced a new way of working with colours. AI generate images were created around the idea of various colours, which are then sampled to a number of points. When a shape in the design needs a colour then it picks and interpolates from a point in the sampled images, sometimes flipping the x and y axis to generate variations.

Four special palettes; New York, London, Paris, Munich were also introduced at this point.
